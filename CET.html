					<h3>Project Description</h3>
					<section>
						<p>This scope of this project included setting up a website with a database, integrating security by design, utilizing the programming skills I have aquired to create an application, connecting a native Android application to a website hosted database, and researching how to implement a Google Maps fragment into the native application. The GitHub repository for this project is currently set to private to keep the Google Maps API key secured. If you would like access to the GitHub repository, please email me by using the link provided in the footer of this web page.</p>

					<h3>What I Learned by Working on This Project</h3>
					<section>
						<p>Working on this project helped me learn a lot about developing an Android application and connecting it to outside resources. Prior to this project I had only created Android applicaiton that did not connect to any outside resources. I learned how to utilize PHP on my website to interact with a database and have said PHP return a JSON array. The application would log the use in if they input authorized credentials and would retrieve information from the database through a JSON file. This JSON file was then broken down into events to be inserted into a RecyclerView and displayed to the user. The research with integrating a Google Maps fragment was used to display the location of the event they selected from the RecyclerView using the latitude and longitude stored in the event object. In the end, this project was accomplished successfully and was a great learning experience. It helped me understand how applications and the web interact with each other, how the application can retrieve information from websites to display to the user, and how to work with Google APIs.</p>
