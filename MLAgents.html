					<h3>Project Description</h3>
					<section>
						<p>This scope of this project included setting up a website with a database, integrating security by design, utilizing the programming skills I have aquired to create a game, and researching how to implement the Machine Learning Agents for Unity into the game. The GitHub repository is currently set to private to keep potentially sensitive information, such as access codes, secure. If you would like access to the GitHub repository, please email me by using the link provided in the footer of this web page.</p>

					<h3>What I Learned by Working on This Project</h3>
					<section>
						<p>This project helped me bring everything I have learned throughout my college career together. The project included aspects of security, networking, database administration, general programming, and game design. I learned how to use PHP to connect my website to a database how to create a login system for my game. The most important thing I have learned from this project is how to apply the Machine Learning Agents package to a game and train an AI using reinforcement machine learning techniques. I enjoyed learning about the basics of machine learning in my other classes and had fun learning how to apply these techniques to game AI. In the end, the AI in training performed perfectly; however, when applying the neural network generated by the training to the AI in the game, the AI would not function properly. Despite this, the project was an excellent learning experience and helped me reinforce my understanding of machine learning while also showing me a new way to apply that understanding.</p>
