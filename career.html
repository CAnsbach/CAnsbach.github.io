					<h3>Work Experience</h3>
					<section>
						<p>I worked as a programming intern at Solar Innovations for 2 years where I primarily created, updated, and maintained reports using SQL Server and SSRS. During this internship I got my first experience working IT and learned how to communicate effectively with other developers and other co-workers. I also work as a math and CIT tutor for my college which further reinforced my communcation skills. This website lists some of the projects that I have worked on through my college career and provides links to the associated GitHub repository, if available. I have aquired many skills during my college career and are looking to apply and improve those skills in my industry.</p>
					</section>
					<section>

						<p>I attended the Pennsylvania Collge of Technology in Williamsport, PA for four and a half years. I graduated in December of 2021 with dual Bachelor's degrees in Gaming and Simulation Programming and Software Development and Information Management as well as a minor in Mathematics.</p>
